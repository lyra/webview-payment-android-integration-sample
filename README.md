## How it works

To be able to do some payments, two elements are required::
* A contract with your Payment service provider
* A mobile app with a webview mobile payment integration: this integration is explained with this repository.
* A merchant server that executes payments transactions with the payment servers: [merchant server demonstration](https://github.com/lyra/webview-payment-sparkjava-integration-sample)

<span id="getting_started"></span>
## Getting started

### Execute this sample

1. See merchant server repo, `https://github.com/lyra/webview-payment-sparkjava-integration-sample`. Follow steps of getting started chapter and run your server

2. Clone the repo, `git clone https://github.com/lyra/webview-payment-android-integration-sample.git`. 

3. Open the project under Android Studio

4. Edit the following field in `MainActivity.kt`
    - SERVER_URL: replace by your merchant server url

5. Run it and that's all! :)


### Integration in an existing app

1. See merchant server repo, `https://github.com/lyra/webview-payment-sparkjava-integration-sample`. Follow steps of getting started chapter and run your server

2. Copy-paste `com.lyranetwork.sampleandroidwebview.payment` package into your project

3. Add the following code  into your AndroidManifest file

    ```xml
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />`
    ```
    
    In application part, add the embedded payment activity:
    ```xml
    <activity
        android:name=".payment.PaymentActivity" />
    ```
    
	<p align="center">
	  <img src="embedded_activity.png"/>
	</p>
    
4. In your activity where you want execute a payment, add an inheritance of this activity to `AbstractPaymentActivity`.

	Example:
	```kotlin
	class MainActivity: AbstractPaymentActivity() {
	```

5. Execute `PaymentProvider.execute(payload: PaymentData, serverUrl: String, activity: Activity)` method by providing the following fields:
	- serverUrl: replace by your merchant server url
    - payload: PaymentData that represents your payment data:
		- mode: *mandatory*, TEST or PRODUCTION (your targeted environment)
		- orderId: *optional*, your order identifier
		- amount: *mandatory*, the related amount
		- email: *optional*, email
		- cardType: *optional*, can be CB, VISA, MASTERCARD, so on. If no provided, any card type will be proposed
		- currency: *mandatory*, currency code, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217
	
	Example:
	```kotlin
	val payload = PaymentData()
    payload.setOrderId(orderText.text.toString())
    payload.setAmount(amountText.text.toString())
    payload.setEmail(emailText.text.toString())
    payload.setMode("TEST")
	payload.setCurrency("978")
		
	PaymentProvider.execute(payload, "http://my-merchant-server", this)
	```
	
6. Implement `handlePaymentResult(result: PaymentResult)` in order to handle the payment result.

	Example:
	```kotlin
	override fun handlePaymentResult(result: PaymentResult) {
        if (result.isSuccess()) {
            Toast.makeText(this, "Payment successful" , Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show()
        } else {
            Toast.makeText(this, "Payment failed. errorCode = " + result.getErrorCode() + " and cause = " + result.getCause() , Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show()
        }
    }
	```

7. Run it and that's all! :)

## Additional features

Also, two additional features can be used:
* Credit card scanning by mobile camera

In the branch below, you can see a demonstration of credit card scanning by mobile camera based on [Card.io SDK](https://www.card.io/)

https://github.com/lyra/webview-payment-android-integration-sample/tree/card_scanning/

* Credit card scanning by NFC

In the branch below, you can see a demonstration of credit card scanning by NFC based on [EMV NFC Card](https://github.com/devnied/EMV-NFC-Paycard-Enrollment)
